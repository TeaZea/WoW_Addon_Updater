# WoW_Addon_Updater

Application to update World of Warcraft without copying/replacing/removing files manually. Application should take .zips from download folder, unzips, copy and overwrites files in the WoWAddon Folder before deleting the .zip.

Challenges {

- Finding a proper 'listening' method to monitor all .zips that come into the /downloads/ folder and move them properly (need a method with built-in regex).

}
